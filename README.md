This project focuses on dataset of Parking Statistics in North America which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/terenceshin/searching-for-parking-statistics-in-north-america
Why I chose dataset of parking statistics in North America? This dataset relates to very important problem which is time required to park a car in very dense areas. During the pandemic times it can be potentially observed that some fluctuation apply to this statistics, due to increase in remote work across professionals who are mostly working in city centre areas in the office areas. As can be generally observed, the more populated city the time required for parking a car longer.
